ComponentOne Studio controls require a valid license for runtime testing and distribution. An active subscription to ComponentOne Studio Enterprise, Studio for Xamarin, WPF Edition, UWP Edition, or ComponentOne Ultimate is required to generate valid licenses.

WPF apps require all components be listed in the licenses.licx file which is automatically generated when a licensed component is added to a form.

Xamarin and UWP apps require a runtime app key. App keys are validated at runtime and continue to remain active indefinitely until the app identifier changes or the controls are updated to a version outside the subscription window.
